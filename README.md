# StockReturnsComovements-multiGARCH

This repository contains an analysis focused on stock market comovements between Central Europe and the USA. It uses multivariate GARCH approach, specifically an asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation (ADCC) model. The project is kept short to give a quick overview of R codes and presents succinctly the main results. It is based on a paper by Gjika and Horv√°th (2013) (references included in the files).
