# An investigation into stock market comovements between Central Europe and the USA using the ADCC model

This repository contains an analysis focused on stock market comovements between Central Europe and the USA. It uses multivariate GARCH approach, specifically an asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation (ADCC) model. The project is kept short, gives a quick overview of codes in R (using Quarto in R Studio), and presents succinctly the main results. It is based on a paper by Gjika and Horv√°th (2013) (references included in the files).
